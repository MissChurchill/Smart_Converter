# Smart_Converter
An app to help users convert Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures

For this project, I built an app that lets the user convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. This is the very first app that I developed on my journey to become an Android Developer in the Google Fellowship program. It is also one of my favorite apps because I had so much fun creating it!This is when I fell in love with building apps. The highlight and most fond memory of this app is how well it was received during class when I presented it. For the most part everyone else in the class created a very simple app. I had fun with mine and added the image of the rapper Nelly and gave my app a theme around his hit song "Hot in Herre." When the instructor said that my app was one of her favorites I was on cloud nine. Super excited. And, of course, I set the bar with this app and after that day my fellow peers brought their "A" game and took the creativity in the design of their apps to a new level.  

Topics learned during the creation of this app:
1. Introduction to Kotlin
2. Layouts in Android
3. TextViews 
4. Basic styling for Android apps
5. Handling user interaction
